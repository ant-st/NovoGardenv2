# Novo Garden - landscape architect's website

This is my first website made commercially. I made it using HTML+CSS+JS + React framework. This is a one-page-website, as it is relatively small and does not need additional links.

## Responsiveness

The page is suitable for being launched both on desktop and mobile devices. I worked hard especially for tailoring it up to iPhones, because of the common notch problems. The size of text and images change dinamically depending on the screen size. The website uses CSS Flex in order to dynamically sort images in the gallery and on main site. All of the links are opened in new tabs and contact buttons are active.

## Colors and graphics

The logo and photos I have used had been created by my customer. I chose the website's color palette to match the main theme. 

## Frameworks

The only external framework and component I have used is AOS (animation-on-scroll). I have been looking for a very long time for a perfect lightbox gallery, unable to find one I implemented my own. I am also proud of my solution allowing to add images to gallery automatically - the website displays all of the proper files from the Pictures directory
